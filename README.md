# HydroTrinket
A simple, Adafruit Trinket based hydroponics controller.
This controller is for a flood and drain style hydropnics system, and uses two relays to control a pump and valve.
The addition of another relay would allow for the controlling of lighting, but would require significant code revisions.
## Parts
Parts can be found [here] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ME8IFVZWPX8O/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_o?reveal=all&view=null).
## Assembly

All of the electronics sit comfortably inside of the conduit box, which also houses the system switch and outlets.
